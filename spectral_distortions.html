			Primordial non-Gaussianity can source μ-distortion anisotropies that are correlated with the large-scale
			temperature and polarization signals of the cosmic microwave background. A measurement of μT and μE
			correlations can therefore be used to constrain it on wavelengths of perturbations not directly probed by
			the standard CMB anisotropies. We have run thorough forecasts for a variety of state-of-the-art and upcoming
			surveys, and developed a pipeline based on needlet constrained internal linear combination which we have
			applied to <i>Planck</i> data.
			Doing so, we have reconstructed for the first time a temperature-free <i>Planck</i> μ map, and we have set
			the first constraints on local non-Gaussianity which use the whole multipole information and polarization
			data.<br>

		<h4>Evolution of anisotropic spectral distortions</h4>

			Inhomogeneous spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background, which arise naturally from
			non-homogeneous energy injections, evolve in a perturbed universe obeying a high-dimensional system of
			partial differential equation, which stems from the fact that the spectral evolution has to be explicitly
			taken into account.
			We show that by expanding the photon spectrum in a basis generated by the boost operator the complexity of
			the calculation reduces drastically, and the problem can be described by a common hierarchy of Boltzmann
			equations. These can be integrated using the procedure commonly adopted to calculate temperature
			fluctuation, which enabled us to calculate the spectral distortion angular power spectra. As a case study,
			we have forecasted the detectability of instantaneous energy injection and of a decaying particle
			scenario.<br>
